## Magento 2 Recent Order Notification 
[**Recent order notification Magento 2 extension by Magepow**](https://magepow.com/magento-2-recent-order-notification.html) shows beautiful recent sales popups to notify visitors of recently bought items. When you have very small amount of order, you can show fake orders instead to attract customers.

On the small popup, the extension allows store owners to show the main information of the product. Therefore, customers or visitors can have brief information about that product or also click on the popup to go directly to the product detail page. They also can close it by just one click if they feel it is annoying.
