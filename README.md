## Magento 2 Order Notification 
**Recent order notification Magento 2 extension** shows beautiful recent sales popups to notify visitors of recently bought items. When you have very small amount of order, you can show fake orders instead to attract customers.

They also can close it by just one click if they feel it is annoying.
